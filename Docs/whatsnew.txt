- New features of the version 1.82 -

1. Bug fix in "Ignore Desktop".
2. "Activate Window" now ignores PMX windows.
3. You can use mouse button 1 to raise the window
   except for WIN-OS2 windows when "Change Window Z-Order" is on.
   WIN-OS2 windows are ignored to avoid strange behavior.
4. "Ignore Buttonless Dialogs" now exactly ignores buttonless dialogs.
   Previous version ignored all buttonless windows, including folders.
5. Command line options -p and -q are added.
6. Hot key for command execution.
